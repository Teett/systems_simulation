# Discrete event Systems simulation - León XIII Clinic - Emergency department

This project aims to fit distributions to the services inside the emergency department of the León XIII clinic, located in Medellín - Colombia using real data from the users and their arrivals. Extensive use of the `fitdistrplus` package is made in the development of this methodology.

After the distributions are fitted, discrete event simulation will be performed using Simul8 to stablish performance measures and prescriptive analytics that could improve the decision making process.
